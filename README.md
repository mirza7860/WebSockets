## Introduction

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for understanding WebSocket technology and Socket.io library. It covers fundamental concepts, implementation details, and building a real-time communication project.

## WebSocket Theory

### What is WebSocket?

**WebSocket** is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional request-response-based communication (HTTP), WebSocket allows bidirectional communication, enabling real-time data transfer between a client and a server.

#### Key Features:

- Bidirectional Communication
- Low Latency
- Efficiency
- Full-Duplex Communication
- Protocol Upgrade
- Wide Range of Applications

#### How WebSocket Works:

1. **Handshake:**
   - The communication starts with an HTTP handshake. The client sends an HTTP request to initiate the connection.

2. **Upgrade:**
   - If the server supports WebSocket, it responds with an HTTP 101 status code, indicating a successful upgrade to the WebSocket protocol.

3. **Bidirectional Communication:**
   - Once the connection is established, both the client and server can send messages independently at any time.

4. **Close Connection:**
   - Either party can close the connection gracefully when needed.

## Socket.io Theory

### What is Socket.io?

**Socket.io** is a library built on top of WebSocket that simplifies real-time communication between clients and servers. It provides additional features and abstractions to handle various scenarios, making it easier to build real-time applications.

#### Key Features:

- Real-Time Bi-Directional Communication
- Fallback Mechanism
- Rooms and Namespaces
- Auto-Reconnect
- Event Handling
- Cross-Browser Compatibility

#### How Socket.io Works:

1. **Establishing Connection:**
   - The client establishes a connection with the server using the Socket.io library.

2. **Transport Selection:**
   - Socket.io selects the best available transport (WebSocket, long polling, etc.) based on browser support and network conditions.

3. **Bi-Directional Communication:**
   - Clients and servers can emit events and listen for events, allowing bidirectional communication.

4. **Fallback Mechanism:**
   - If WebSocket is not supported, Socket.io falls back to other transport mechanisms for communication.

5. **Rooms and Namespaces:**
   - Socket.io provides features like rooms and namespaces for organizing communication channels.

6. **Auto-Reconnect:**
   - Socket.io attempts to reconnect in case of a connection drop, ensuring robustness in real-time applications.

## Live Demo

## Project Structure

The project is organized into folders, each demonstrating different aspects of WebSocket and Socket.io implementation. Follow the folders in sequential order to understand and implement WebSocket concepts progressively.

### 1. WebSocket

In this folder, the core WebSocket functionality is explored. It demonstrates a simple client-server communication over WebSocket. When a client sends an input, the server responds, but it doesn't update all clients simultaneously.

### 2. Socket.io

This folder showcases the usage of Socket.io for real-time updates across all clients. It builds upon the WebSocket foundation, introducing Socket.io to enable synchronized communication between clients.

### 3. ChatApp

The ChatApp folder contains a complete chat application. Users can join specific rooms and engage in real-time conversations with other users within the same room. This implementation goes beyond basic WebSocket functionality and Socket.io integration, providing a more comprehensive chat experience.

Explore each folder to delve deeper into WebSocket and Socket.io concepts, gradually progressing from foundational principles to a complete chat application.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Socket.io for real-time communication

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Socket.io for WebSocket communication

## Setup Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mirza7860/WebSockets.git
   cd ChatApp
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
- The app will be available at http://localhost:8000.
